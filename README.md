# Advent of Code 2023

My attempts at solving the [Advent of Code puzzles](https://adventofcode.com). 
Mostly Python solutions, but I'll try to do C++ ones when I can.

## Running the Python code

You can run the solutions from the command line by doing something like `python run.py -y 2021 -d 1`, where the `-d` is the number of the day whose puzzle you want to run and `-y` is the year. 
You can leave off `-y` and it'll default to the current year.
If you run it with the `-t` flag, then it will run the sample dataset provided on the website and test that the expected solution is reached. 
For example, `python run.py -d 1 -t` will run the sample dataset for day 1 of the current year.
