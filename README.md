# Advent of Code 2023

My attempts at solving the [Advent of Code 2023 puzzles]([url](https://adventofcode.com)https://adventofcode.com). 
This year, I'll try to do solutions in both Python and C++. 

## Running the Python code

You can run the solutions from the command line by doing something like `python run.py -d 1`, where the number is the day whose puzzle you want to run. 
If you run it with the `-t` flag, then it will run the sample dataset provided on the website and test that the expected solution is reached. 
For example, `python run.py -d 1 -t` will run the sample dataset for day 1 and test the solutions.
